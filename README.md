# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description

We all have a lot to do during the day and live busy lives. A planner or calnder can help us with staying organized. Being able to make a work day scheduler can help someone plan their workday properly. This project is a good way to test out the information I have learned so far in this course. It solves the problem of being able to have a work day planner in which you are able to save your activity for that hour and throughout the day. I have also learned how to incorporate switch statements, getElementbyID and use local storage in JavaScript to make the application work. 

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

You are able to write on the time frame of the work day scheduler and click on the save icon. When you refresh the page, the event will be saved.
